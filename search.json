    "text": "How to Use This Handbook\nThis handbook is structured to serve multiple purposes: as a learning resource for newcomers, a reference guide for daily development work, and a comprehensive standard for our entire development lifecycle.\n\nFor New Team Members\nIf you’re new to the team, we recommend reading through the handbook sequentially, starting with the development environment setup in Chapter 2. Pay particular attention to:\n\nChapters 2-3: Essential for getting your development environment configured correctly\nChapters 4-8: Core practices that you’ll use in every project\nChapters 17-18: Team collaboration practices and communication guidelines\n\nConsider the first few chapters as mandatory reading, while later chapters can be referenced as needed based on your specific projects and responsibilities.\n\n\nFor Experienced Developers\nUse this handbook as a reference guide and decision-making tool. Each chapter is designed to be self-contained, allowing you to quickly find information relevant to your current task. Key reference sections include:\n\nQuick decision trees for choosing between different tools or approaches\nCode examples that demonstrate preferred patterns and anti-patterns\nChecklists for code reviews, testing, and deployment\nConfiguration templates that can be copied and adapted for new projects\n\n\n\nFor Project Planning\nWhen starting new projects or making architectural decisions, relevant chapters can guide technology choices, project structure, and implementation approaches. The handbook provides decision frameworks that consider our specific technical constraints, team capabilities, and business objectives.\n\n\nStaying Current\nThis is a living document that evolves with our practices, tools, and understanding. Check the revision history and changelog regularly, and subscribe to updates when significant changes are made. When you encounter outdated information or have suggestions for improvement, please contribute using the process outlined in section 1.3.\n\n\nIntegration with Daily Workflow\nThis handbook is designed to integrate seamlessly with your development workflow. Many sections include:\n\nIDE configurations that can be imported directly into your development environment\nScripts and automation that implement handbook guidelines\nTemplates and boilerplates for common development tasks\nLinks to relevant tools and resources referenced throughout our development process",

    "text": "Contributing to This Document\nThis handbook represents our collective knowledge and experience, and it improves through the contributions of every team member. We encourage active participation in keeping this document current, accurate, and useful.\n\nPhilosophy of Continuous Improvement\nOur development practices evolve as we learn from experience, adopt new technologies, and respond to changing requirements. This handbook should reflect our current understanding and practices, not historical decisions or aspirational goals. Every guideline should be backed by practical experience and measurable benefits to our development process.\n\n\nTypes of Contributions\nWe welcome several types of contributions:\nContent Updates: When you discover outdated information, encounter new best practices, or identify gaps in coverage, please propose updates. This includes everything from correcting typos to adding entirely new sections.\nPractical Examples: Real-world code examples, configuration files, and case studies from actual projects make the handbook more valuable. Share examples that illustrate both successful patterns and lessons learned from challenges.\nTool and Process Improvements: As we adopt new tools or refine our processes, the handbook should reflect these changes. Contribute sections on new technologies, updated workflows, or improved automation.\nClarifications and Explanations: If you find sections unclear or confusing, help improve them. Often, a fresh perspective can identify areas that need better explanation or more context.\n\n\nContribution Process\nAll changes to this handbook follow our standard code review process:\n\nCreate a feature branch from the main documentation repository\nMake your changes following our documentation standards (outlined in Chapter 14)\nTest any code examples to ensure they work as documented\nSubmit a pull request with a clear description of the changes and rationale\nEngage in review discussion and iterate based on feedback\nMerge after approval from at least two team members\n\n\n\nDocumentation Standards\nWhen contributing to this handbook, follow these guidelines:\n\nWrite for your audience: Assume readers have Python experience but may be new to our specific practices\nBe concise but complete: Provide enough context for understanding without unnecessary verbosity\nInclude practical examples: Abstract principles should be accompanied by concrete code examples\nLink to external resources: Reference official documentation, authoritative sources, and relevant tools\nMaintain consistency: Follow the established tone, structure, and formatting throughout the document\n\n\n\nReview and Maintenance\nThe handbook undergoes regular review cycles to ensure accuracy and relevance:\nQuarterly Reviews: Each quarter, chapter owners review their sections for accuracy and completeness, updating content based on recent experience and changes in our practices.\nAnnual Architecture Review: Once per year, we conduct a comprehensive review of the handbook’s structure, scope, and alignment with our evolving needs.\nContinuous Feedback: We maintain an open feedback channel where team members can report issues, suggest improvements, or request clarification on any handbook content.\n\n\nOwnership and Accountability\nWhile everyone contributes to the handbook, specific chapters have designated owners who are responsible for maintaining accuracy and currency in their areas of expertise. These owners are typically the team members with the deepest knowledge in each domain and serve as the primary reviewers for changes in their sections.\nThis distributed ownership model ensures that the handbook reflects deep expertise while remaining accessible to all team members for contributions and improvements.\n\nsource\n\n\nfoo\n\n foo ()",
