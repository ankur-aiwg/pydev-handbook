    "\n",
    "### Philosophy of Continuous Improvement\n",
    "\n",
    "Our development practices evolve as we learn from experience, adopt new technologies, and respond to changing requirements. This handbook should reflect our current understanding and practices, not historical decisions or aspirational goals. Every guideline should be backed by practical experience and measurable benefits to our development process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Contributions\n",
